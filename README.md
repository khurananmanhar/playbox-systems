# Playbox Sales System

## Description
The Playbox Sales System is a program designed to read and analyze sales data from Playbox Inc. It facilitates the identification of top-selling products, calculates the average cost and retail prices of all products, and provides insights into revenue and profits. Utilizing a user-friendly GUI, the program offers functionalities for data input, data viewing, data manipulation, and data storage.

## Usage
1. **Data Input**
   - Users can input data manually by entering information into designated input fields and clicking the "Add" button. Error messages will prompt users if there are input validation issues.
   - Alternatively, users can import data from a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file by clicking the "Read" button and selecting a file from their computer. The program will automatically sort the imported data based on the number of each product sold, with the top-selling product displayed first.

2. **Data Manipulation**
   - Users have the option to delete specific data entries by clicking the "Delete" button and entering the index of the data to be removed. The program will update the data accordingly, including any imported files.
   - Edited data can be saved by clicking the "Save" button, prompting users to select an existing CSV file to store the updated information.

3. **Analysis**
   - The program offers insights into average prices and costs by clicking the "Average" button, which generates a pop-up displaying the calculated averages.
