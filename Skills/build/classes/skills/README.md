Project Title: Playbox Sales System

Description: This program is used to read and traverse Playbox Incs sales data of their products. It helps them to find their top-selling products and to calculate their average cost and retail prices of all their products. It does this by using a GUI to display the data, math operations to find the averages as well and comparing the number of each product sold in order to find the top selling product.
